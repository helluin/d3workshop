//Think of layout as a tool that use the data you feed in to generate all the data( xy position, size of shapes, path coordinates) to draw the shapes later. 



//Generate the layout data 


//load the data, then:
//1.use the layout instance to generate drawing data
//2.draw the shapes using the generated data
